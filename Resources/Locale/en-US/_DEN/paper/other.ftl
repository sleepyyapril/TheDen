    Good morning to any who sees this.

    You might notice your weapon is missing, which is indeed the case.
    This move was approved and ordered by Central Command, who
    needed it back home. We hope you don't mind having less to work with,
    but we assume you'll be just fine given what you have available to you.

    Thank you for understanding.
