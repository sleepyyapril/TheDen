    Important! Read before playing:
    You have an urge to steal something today.
    You want something interesting, but you're after the thrill of the heist, not material value.
    You only want to steal one item, or a collection of unimportant but similar items.
    You don't want items so important that CentComm or the station will hunt you down.
    Avoid harming others at all costs.
    Don't do anything to endanger your heist or spend more time in jail.
