book-text-epistemics1 = THE EFFECTS OF HIGH GLIMMER LEVELS

      On a shift I served on one of our backwater stations, we had an eccentric mystagogue as our only command member.
      Their magnum opus experiment was to... raise the Glimmer as far as they could, up until our grammateus couldn't tell how much there was.
      Thankfully, nobody was harmed. But as the Glimmer gloomed, I'd started feeling its metallic smell, started feeling the pain of being in outer space.
      And then, I saw the universe as a whole. I'd seen every movement, every thought, star, galaxy, in a dim blue marble in front of me.
      When our mystagogue finally stopped, and failed to break the veil... the station felt off. Cramped, fragile with the eight of us.
      Maybe they weren't crazy. I know now the universe is MASSIVELY smaller than it seems.
