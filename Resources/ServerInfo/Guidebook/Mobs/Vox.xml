  [color=#ffa500]Warning! This species is not recommended for new players due to their fatal allergy to oxygen![/color]

  Vox breathe nitrogen, and [color=#ffa500]oxygen is toxic to them.[/color]
  Unfortunately, space stations tend to be full of oxygen,
  so Vox must use an internal nitrogen supply at almost all times to avoid fatal exposure.

  Vox do not spawn with nitrogen equipment by default.
  It is highly recommended to have a breathing mask and a nitrogen tank in your loadout.

  In addition to regular foods, Vox can also eat various snack packaging, banana peels, eggshells, and raw meat without any ill effects. They also like to drink welding fuel.

  Vox [color=#1e90ff]slowly recover from low levels of poison damage[/color] on their own,
  so long as they are careful not to exceed 20 overall damage.
  This allows them to endure breathing station air for up to thirty seconds at a time without lasting damage,
  letting them quickly eat, drink, take oral medication, and so on.
  A thirty second oxygen exposure takes them two minutes to recover from.
  If their health does not seem to improve within a minute of oxygen exposure, they should seek medical attention.

  Vox deal Slash damage with their unarmed attack.
  Vox can also speak Vox-Pidgin: a chaotic, screeching language that grates on the ears of most listeners.
  While it can be learned, it requires a Vox's unique Syrinx to speak.
