  [color=#808080]Shadowkin are [color=#b3b3b3]young adults[/color] until age 50, [color=#b3b3b3]adults[/color] until age 100, [color=#b3b3b3]middle-aged[/color] until age 150, [color=#b3b3b3]older[/color] until age 200, and [color=#b3b3b3]elderly[/color] beyond that point.[/color]

  Shadowkin are a mysterious race of psionic aliens of extradimensional origin.

  They natively speak the Marish language.

  ## Positive Traits
  -[color=#1e90ff]Anaerobic Nature[/color]:
  As a result of living in a dimension with very little air, Shadowkin have a unique organ known as a core instead of a more traditional set of lungs. This core makes it so that they do not need to respirate to survive.

  -[color=#1e90ff]Innate Telepathy[/color]:
  Shadowkin are innately telepathic, allowing them to communicate with other psions at will.

  -[color=#1e90ff]Psionic Species[/color]:
  Shadowkin as a species are uniquely predisposed to learn new psionic abilities, in part owing to their home dimension being incredibly hostile to those who do not have a strong connection to the noosphere.

<!--  -[color=#1e90ff]Resting[/color]:
  Shadowkin are able to fall into a deep and powerful sleep to quickly recover mana to use their psionic abilities sooner than others.-->##

   Negative Traits
  -[color=#ffa500]Fragile[/color]:
  Shadowkin are vulnerable to damage from an array of sources, taking [color=#ffa500]20% more Slash and Heat damage[/color], as well as an additional [color=#ffa500]10% more pierce damage[/color].
  
  - Shadowkin enter a critical state at [color=#ffa500]80 total damage[/color] and die at [color=#ffa500]180 total damage.[/color]

  -[color=#ffa500]Breathless[/color]:
  Since Shadowkin do not breathe, they are incapable from benefiting from the positive effects of gasses like Healium. When a Shadowkin enters critical condition, they accumulate bloodloss damage rather than the asphyxiation that is common in other species.

  -[color=#ffa500]Easy Target[/color]:
  Due to the fact that they're inherently psionic, they make for the easy targets of over-eager epistemics staff... as well as any other malicious noospheric entities.

  -[color=#ffa500]Lightweight[/color]:
  Shadowkin are naturally shorter and lighter than most species, making them more easily grabbed, picked up, or thrown.
