  The Canid (Cay-Nid) are similar to Felinids, except a hydrid of dog traits on a human frame.
  Hailing from a colony of genetic engineers, the species has become distinct enough to be classed by itself.

  ## Diet

  - Can eat raw meat.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  ## Benefits

  - Slightly smaller than humans on average, and slightly harder to hit because of that.
  - Hardened stomachs make them more 20% more resistant to poisoning.
  - Due to extensive gene tailoring their cells wound up 15% more resiliant to ionizing radiation.
  - Can use their hightened olfactory senses to track scents.

  ## Drawbacks

  - They take increased 20% slash, blunt, and heat damage.
  - Colorblind by nature, though different eyes can offset this.
  - Slightly lower stamina than other species.
