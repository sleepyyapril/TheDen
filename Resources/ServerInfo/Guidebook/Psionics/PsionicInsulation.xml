Psionic Insulation is a catch-all term for any source of protection from mind-affecting psionic powers, as well as some noospheric discharges. It is most commonly obtained from wearing special
protective headgear, or from drugs such as Cryptobiolin that render one temporarily protected. Some entities can be innately insulated, such as nearly all forms of synthetic life, though
exceptions may exist. Rarer still, some humanoids may be born with an innate psionic insulation.
