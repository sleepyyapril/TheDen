# This file is mostly for species restriction lists.
# Keep in mind that there is no partial inheritance of species restrictions, so you have to redeclare the entire

# Species that use the "standard" body/head shape.
# Excluded species:
# - Different body/head size and shape.
# - For example: digitigrade legs, radical body size differences.
# Not excluded species:
# - Snouts, tails, other "additions" to the base.
# Use for: Markings that fit reasonably well on the humanoid sprite base.
# Avoid using for: Markings that look weird on snouted species. (Sides/back/top of head are fine.)

# Non-standard species restrictions.
# Why single-species restrictions, you ask? I would like to minimize the amount of `speciesRestriction` redeclaration
# in general. Always easier to edit one prototype than it is to edit potentially dozens. Maybe you add a species that
# has an identical body but does something different - not that I recommend this.
